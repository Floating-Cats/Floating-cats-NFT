### Our Road Map

- After 100% mint, we will donate to multuple shleters 10 ETH (The community will decide on the shelters).
- Exclusive Merchandise (Weekly Giveaways)
- $FLOAT coin utilities
- Community vault
- Opening a cat café and partner with shelters (All hodlers will have free items and discount every time they visit the store)
- **And yes we understand our holders will be all around the world, so we decided to pay for your trip and come to the grand opening!**

### Our Vision

We are a team locateed in Nagoya, Japan. We love cats. Our goal is to build a strong community in order to help as many cats as possible. Our plan is to team up with local shelters and provide them with the needs (all future updates will be posted on [twitter](https://twitter.com/FloatingCatsNFT)).

And of course, we are also planning to have weekly/monthly events to help shelters voluntary. And it doesn't stop there, we're committed and wish to expand this moment worldwide.

Most of all, opening a cat café is always our dream. We will team up with local shlters and provide a space for cats to stay in the store with good care. Meanwhile, we help those kitties to find a new home.

[We will consistenly update some videos and pictures for the opening of the store.]

### Our Application

- React framework for our website.
- Hardhat-waffle for automatic testing for our contracts.
- ether.js to interact with smart contracts in the browser.
- openzepplelin to build our industry-standard smart contracts.

### How To Begin

- run `git pull origin main` (and solve merge conflicts).
- run `npx hardhat node`. This creates a mock network on localhost and provides a bunch of fake accounts (should always be running in the background).
- run `npx hardhat compile`. This runs the solidity compiler to convert your code (`./contracts`) into binary.
- run `npx hardhat run scripts/MyScript.js --network localhost`

### How To Test

- run
